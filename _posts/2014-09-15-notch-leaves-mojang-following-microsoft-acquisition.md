> I don’t see myself as a real game developer. I make games because it’s fun, and because I love games and I love to program, but I don’t make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits, and I don’t try to change the world. Minecraft certainly became a huge hit, and people are telling me it’s changed games. I never meant for it to do either.

I've never played Minecraft on any platform since its release.  I'm just not interested in that type of game.  It would be hard to argue however that Minecraft hasn't profoundly marked millions of gamers of this decade with its immense popularity.

Notch writes his open letter of resignation and humbly explains his decision, unveiling the human behind the internet persona.
