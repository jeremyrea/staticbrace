Octopress doesn't play nice yet with linked lists for blog posts.  Luckily, Jonathan Poritsky wrote up on his blog ([The Candler Blog](http://www.candlerblog.com)) an excellent piece to get things working properly; post titles with glyphs pointing to external URL's, permalinks and editing the RSS feed.

The result is something just like this post.
