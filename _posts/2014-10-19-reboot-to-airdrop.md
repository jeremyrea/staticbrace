---

With the recent update to OS X Yosemite, it's now possible to send files via AirDrop between Mac and iOS devices.  With the sudden need to do so, I went ahead and enabled AirDrop on the iPhone and expected my devices to see each other.  Alas, no such luck.  All the info pointed out on the internet simply says to enable the service and you should be good to go.  

If you encounter this problem as well, the good old "did you try turning it off and on again" does just the trick.
