Owners of iOS devices await today for the next release (iOS 8) to be pushed to them.

There is a sense of excitement I haven't had in a long time - awaiting for a software update to an operating system that I know everyone will receive more or less at the same time.  It kind of sounds funny put that way.

My [previous phone](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_incredible_s-3788.php) didn't have that novelty though.  Instead I found myself scavenging  forums for the latest Nightly releases of CyanogenMod or other flavour for over 3 years.  It has its value, if you're into that kid of thing.  But the excitement wears-off after some time and it becomes a chore.

So I sit here waiting for my first iOS update.  Something new is always welcome and geeks love new software.  It reminds me of Linux distro upgrades in a sense.
