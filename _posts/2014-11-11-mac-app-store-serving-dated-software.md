It's come to my attention that the versions of many apps in the Mac App Store are behind their latest releases outside the App Store.  A certain delay is understandable, giving Apple the time to review changes and such before accepting the new release.  Some however are multiple releases behind, resulting in months of updates which customers aren't getting.  These updates can ran range from "superfluous" visual changes, to new features and more importantly security fixes.

I found this odd and tried to seek more answers but interstingly enough, not much is written on the subject.  I was only successful in retrieving an article written by [Computer World](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2508199/security0/mac-app-store-s-slow-updates-expose-users-to-security-risks.html) in 2011.

Under the presumption that the App Store was introduced to the Mac in order to offer the same *ease of use* as its iOS counterpart in regards to finding and updating software (aside from the financial cut Apple takes), I have to say that this situation defeats the purpose.  If you can download a piece of software from the App Store as well as from the developer's official site, there is a good chance that the one you'll get from the App Store is outdated in comparison to the other.
