Every year, twice a year, 2 events mark the tech industry.  Each much awaited, people are eager to hear what Apple has to unveil.  June is marked by Apple's WWDC conference, where software is all the talk with an important emphasis on developers.  September holds the unveiling of Apple's next version of their best-selling product, iPhone.

The latter conference was held yesterday, where Apple confirmed the many leaks had over the summer concerning the new iPhone's, named iPhone 6  and iPhone 6 Plus.  Further details on the models are abundant across the web at this point and specs can be found [here](http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/).  More details will become available in 2 weeks time once they are released with a good old iFixit tare-down.

The biggest departure from previous models is obviously in size.  Where the traditional stance was you'd need to be able to reach the top corner with your thumb, they've instead opted to [bring the corner to your thumb](http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/09/a-look-at-apples-reachability-one-hand-mode-for-larger-iphone-6-video/).

The ï£¿Watch, also much speculated, finally became a reality.  Although only to be released later in 2015.

So what does this all mean for the next year in tech, or even Apple's roadmap?  It's a sign, among others, that Apple is willing to listen to the customer and compete with the market instead of their traditional approach of leading the way with the "my way or the highway" mentality. 

Is this inherently a bad thing?  Of course not.  This is so for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, since Steve Job's passing, Apple lost a key figure.  Steve was a talented sales-man, in being able to convince you that you needed anything.  The traditional (figurative) example found on the internet is he'd be able to sell bacon to  a pig.  Without that kind man leading the way, it becomes a much harder task to force upon the customer a single option, dictated by the company.  Secondly Apple had the misfortune of describing its previous products as "magical" and other hyperbolic adjectives.  This created an unrealistic expectation from the public and the press that just isn't possible to live up to every. single. year.  It's simply not a sustainable nor healthy model for a company in the long run.

That being said, it doesn't take anything away from the new products.  If looked at with a neutral opinion, they are indeed nice technological devices easily matching the competition.  Will it be enough to last through a whole year and a new round of Android devices?  That's hard to tell.  They are not revolutionary by any means, more of a logical progression.  They do however perfect past ideas with a refined execution.  And that's good enough.  We don't need a revolution every 12 months.  There is nothing wrong in having to keep your phone for 2 or, God forbid, 3 years.  If you want the new one, you can get the new one.  Your mind has obviously already been made up even before the conference at that point.  The smart watch is still a young market, a niche at the very best.  The public in general hasn't found a practical use for them yet, or the justification of shelling $350 for an extension to their current (already expensive) screen.  They are waiting for someone to tell them why they need one.  2014 might not have been the year, but there is no hurry.

Apple is only a company, run by human beings.  Some people seem to forget that.
