>Unfortunately, not all content and applications providers have embraced openness and neutrality. Unlike BlackBerry, which allows iPhone users to download and use our BBM service, Apple does not allow BlackBerry or Android users to download Appleâ€™s iMessage messaging service. Netflix, which has forcefully advocated for carrier neutrality, has discriminated against BlackBerry customers by refusing to make its streaming movie service available to them. Many other applications providers similarly offer service only to iPhone and Android users. 
	
It is definitely a unique interpretation of net neutrality, however he doesn't have much to lose at this point.  The turnaround of such an adoption would be slow and I don't think that'd give BB enough time with [Samsung's possible acquisition of BB](http://business.financialpost.com/2015/01/21/samsung-electronics-co-ltd-still-pursuing-blackberry-ltd-purchase/#__federated=1) just around the corner.
